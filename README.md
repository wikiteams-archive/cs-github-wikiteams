# GitHub top users

I took the script from Gist [git.io/top](http://git.io/top) and modified it little e.g. to get a bigger number of users. It's good and simple algorithm of getting a list of most active GitHub users. It uses coffeescript.

## Usage

Make sure you’ve got node.js and coffeescript installed.

```bash
# Install deps.
npm install
# Download and format everything.
make

# or

# Download data.
make get

# Generate stats.
make format
```
